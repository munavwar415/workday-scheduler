# Work Day Scheduler

### This is a app for adding tasks and scheduling for normal business hours. The app ranges from 9AM to 9PM, and it is color coded for better understanding of what is current and what has past and what is in the future. If a section is greyed out it has past, if it is red it means you are currently on the scheduled hour, and if the color is green that means that task is upcoming and is in the futue. You can add tasks and save them as well, tasks are saved and loaded from your local storage.
